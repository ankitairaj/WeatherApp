Great! Since you've shared your **project structure screenshot**, **App.jsx code**, and styles, here's a **refined and customized `README.md`** for your weather app — tailored specifically to your folder structure and code:

## 🖼️ UI Preview

> The layout centers the app using Flexbox and adapts colors based on system theme.

```css
:root {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background-color: #242424;
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87);
  font-family: system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

## 🔑 API Key Setup

- Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Copy your API key
- Replace the `apiKey` in `App.jsx`:

```js
const apiKey = 'API Key';
```

> ⚠️ Avoid committing real API keys to public repositories.

---

## 💻 `App.jsx` Overview

```jsx
const [city, setCity] = useState('');
const [weather, setWeather] = useState(null);
const [error, setError] = useState('');

const fetchWeather = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}&units=metric`
    );
    setWeather(response.data);
    setError('');
  } catch (err) {
    setWeather(null);
    setError('City not found!');
  }
};
```

## 🧼 Future Improvements

- 🌍 Add current location (Geolocation API)
- ⏱ Add loading indicator
- 📅 Add previous 5-day forecast
- 🌐 Deploy to Vercel

Would you like me to help you:
- Create a `.env` setup for hiding the API key?
- Add weather icons (based on API)?
- Deploy this project?

Let me know!
